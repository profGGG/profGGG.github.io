              The capabilities of a new class of tools, colloquially known as generative artificial intelligence (AI), is a topic of much debate. One prominent application thus far is the production of high-quality artistic media for visual arts, concept art, music, and literature, as well as video and animation. For example, diffusion models can synthesize high-quality images (
              
                1
              
              ), and large language models (LLMs) can produce sensible-sounding and impressive prose and verse in a wide range of contexts (
              
                2
              
              ). The generative capabilities of these tools are likely to fundamentally alter the creative processes by which creators formulate ideas and put them into production. As creativity is reimagined, so too may be many sectors of society. Understanding the impact of generative AI—and making policy decisions around it—requires new interdisciplinary scientific inquiry into culture, economics, law, algorithms, and the interaction of technology and creativity.},

            The recent emergence of deepfake videos raises theoretical and practical questions. Are humans or the leading machine learning model more capable of detecting algorithmic visual manipulations of videos? How should content moderation systems be designed to detect and flag video-based misinformation? We present data showing that ordinary humans perform in the range of the leading machine learning model on a large set of minimal context videos. While we find that a system integrating human and model predictions is more accurate than either humans or the model alone, we show inaccurate model predictions often lead humans to incorrectly update their responses. Finally, we demonstrate that specialized face processing and the ability to consider context may specially equip humans for deepfake detection.
          , 
            The recent emergence of machine-manipulated media raises an important societal question: How can we know whether a video that we watch is real or fake? In two online studies with 15,016 participants, we present authentic videos and deepfakes and ask participants to identify which is which. We compare the performance of ordinary human observers with the leading computer vision deepfake detection model and find them similarly accurate, while making different kinds of mistakes. Together, participants with access to the model’s prediction are more accurate than either alone, but inaccurate model predictions often decrease participants’ accuracy. To probe the relative strengths and weaknesses of humans and machines as detectors of deepfakes, we examine human and machine performance across video-level features, and we evaluate the impact of preregistered randomized interventions on deepfake detection. We find that manipulations designed to disrupt visual processing of faces hinder human participants’ performance while mostly not affecting the model’s performance, suggesting a role for specialized cognitive capacities in explaining human deepfake detection performance.},

A body of work suggests that introducing social signals to content can increase both the inequality and unpredictability of its success, but has only been shown in the context of music listening. To further examine the effect of social influence on media popularity, we extend this research to the context of algorithmically-generated images by re-adapting Salganik et al's Music Lab experiment. On a digital platform where participants discover and curate AI-generated hybrid animals, we randomly assign both the knowledge of other participants' behavior and the visual presentation of the information. We successfully replicate the Music Lab's findings in the context of images, whereby social influence leads to an unpredictable winner-take-all market. However, we also find that social influence can lead to the emergence of local cultural trends that diverge from the status quo and are ultimately more diverse. We discuss the implications of these results for platform designers and animal conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {There is widespread concern about misinformation circulating on social media. In particular, many argue that the context of social media itself may make people susceptible to the influence of false claims. Here, we test that claim by asking whether simply considering sharing news on social media reduces the extent to which people discriminate truth from falsehood when judging accuracy. In a large online experiment examining coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and political news (N = 3157 Americans), we find support for this possibility. When judging the accuracy of headlines, participants were worse at discerning truth from falsehood if they both evaluated accuracy and indicated their sharing intentions, compared to just evaluating accuracy. These results suggest that people may be particularly vulnerable to believing false claims on social media, given that sharing is a core element of what makes social media “social.”},

Thirty participants selected sculpture-making materials and generated three images using the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator, each with text prompts of their choice, with the aim of informing and then creating a physical sculpture. The majority of participants (23/30) reported that the generated images informed their sculptures, and 28/30 reported interest in using text-to-image models to help them in a creative task in the future. We identify several prompt engineering strategies and find that a participant's prompting strategy relates to their stage in the creative process. We discuss how our findings can inform support for users at different stages of the design process and for using text-to-image models for physical artefact design.},

	abstract = {With more than half of the population of earth now using social media, it has become a critical tool for individuals to gain information about the world around them and to connect with others, and for researchers to build a broad understanding of human behav- ior. However, myopic design patterns of these platforms, as well as the broader attention economy, have enabled the proliferation of misinformation and undermined collective in- telligence. These situating factors motivate a guiding research question for the emerging field of platform design: how does attention operate in digital ecosystems, and how can we design platforms to mitigate misinformation and promote collective intelligence? This dissertation addresses key aspects of this question by arguing that attention operates in a two- stage process (“Try” and “Buy”) on social media. The Try phase (stage 1) involves initial exposure to content, and the Buy phase (stage 2) involves engagement with con- tent conditional on having been exposed to it in the first place. Due to the difficulties of measuring Stage 1 exposure in standard survey experiment settings, most research has focused only on psychological determinants and design interventions for stage 2, neglecting the crucial role attention plays online. To understand the attentional dynamics of stage 2, I will discuss studies on a scalable accuracy prompts that “moves the spotlight of attention” towards peoples’ existing but latent capacity for discerning truth from falsehood. To under- stand the attentional dynamics of stage 1, I will discuss how social influence can impact the content users are exposed on social media environments, via a large scale field experiment with AI-generated hybrid animals (“GANimals”). To directly measure attentional expo- sure to content in addition to engagement, I introduce a new research tool called Yourfeed. Yourfeed is a digital environment that mirrors the attentional context of social media, and tracks both dwell time and engagement for each piece of content. Together, these contribu- tions provide empirical evidence for how attention operates on social media, and highlights a suite of design interventions to promote high-quality interactions with these platforms.},

In experiment (N=128), we investigated how susceptible people are to deceptive AI systems by examining how their ability to discern true news from fake news varies when AI systems are perceived as either human fact-checkers or AI fact-checking systems, and when explanations provided by those fact-checkers are either deceptive or honest. We find that deceitful explanations significantly reduce accuracy, indicating that people are just as likely to believe deceptive AI explanations as honest AI explanations. Although before getting assistance from an AI-system, people have significantly higher weighted discernment accuracy on false headlines than true headlines, we found that with assistance from an AI system, discernment accuracy increased significantly when given honest explanations on both true headlines and false headlines, and decreased significantly when given deceitful explanations on true headlines and false headlines. Further, we did not observe any significant differences in discernment between explanations perceived as coming from a human fact checker compared to an AI-fact checker. Similarly, we found no significant differences in trust. These findings exemplify the dangers of deceptive AI systems and the need for finding novel ways to limit their influence human information processing.},

Prior work identified user engagement and dwell time as two key metrics of attention in digital environments, but these metrics have yet to be integrated into a unified model that can advance the theory andpractice of digital attention. We draw on work from cognitive science, digital advertising, and AI to propose a two-stage model of attention for social media environments that disentangles engagement and dwell. In an online experiment, we show that attention operates differently in these two stages and find clear evidence of dissociation: when dwelling on posts (Stage 1), users attend more to sensational than credible content, but when deciding whether to engage with content (Stage 2), users attend more to credible than sensational content. These findings have implications for the design and development of computational systems that measure and model human attention, such as newsfeed algorithms on social media.},

Some have argued that the presence of these cues promotes the spread of misinformation. Here we investigate the causal effect of social cues on users' engagement with social media posts. We conducted an experiment with N=628 Americans on a custom-built newsfeed interface where we systematically varied the presence and strength of social cues. We find that when cues are shown, indicating that a larger number of others have engaged with a post, users were more likely to share and like that post. Furthermore, relative to a control without social cues, the presence of social cues increased the sharing of true relative to false news. The presence of social cues also makes it more difficult to precisely predict how popular any given post would be. Together, our results suggest that -- instead of distracting users or causing them to share low-quality news -- social cues may, in certain circumstances, actually boost truth discernment and reduce the sharing of misinformation. Our work suggests that social cues play important roles in shaping users' attention and engagement on social media, and platforms should understand the effects of different cues before making changes to what cues are displayed and how.},

In this study, we examine how users respond in their sharing intentions to information they are provided about a hypothetical human-AI hybrid system. We ask i) if these warnings increase discernment in social media sharing intentions and ii) if explaining how the labeling system works can boost the effectiveness of the warnings. To do so, we conduct a study (N=1473 Americans) in which participants indicated their likelihood of sharing content. Participants were randomly assigned to a control, a treatment where false content was labeled, or a treatment where the warning labels came with an explanation of how they were generated. We find clear evidence that both treatments increase sharing discernment, and directional evidence that explanations increase the warnings' effectiveness. Interestingly, we do not find that the explanations increase self-reported trust in the warning labels, although we do find some evidence that participants found the warnings with the explanations to be more informative. Together, these results have important implications for designing and deploying transparent misinformation warning labels, and AI-mediated systems more broadly.},

	abstract = {As language models (LMs) are widely utilized in personalized communication scenarios (e.g., sending emails, writing social media posts) and endowed with a certain level of agency, ensuring they act in accordance with the contextual privacy norms becomes increasingly critical. However, quantifying the privacy norm awareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication is challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive cases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework designed to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further into agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM agents' actions. We instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms grounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, we reveal a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and their actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-the-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68\% and 38.69\% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions. We also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed into multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk.

	abstract = {The growing popularity of generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots such as ChatGPT is having transformative effects on social media. As the prevalence of AI-generated content grows, concerns have been raised regarding privacy and misinformation online. Among social media platforms, Discord enables AI integrations -- making their primarily "Generation Z" userbase particularly exposed to AI-generated content. We surveyed Generation Z aged individuals (n = 335) to evaluate their proficiency in discriminating between AI-generated and human-authored text on Discord. The investigation employed one-shot prompting of ChatGPT, disguised as a text message received on the Discord.com platform. We explore the influence of demographic factors on ability, as well as participants' familiarity with Discord and artificial intelligence technologies. We find that Generation Z individuals are unable to discern between AI and human-authored text (p = 0.011), and that those with lower self-reported familiarity with Discord demonstrated an improved ability in identifying human-authored compared to those with self-reported experience with AI (p {\textless}{\textless} 0.0001). Our results suggest that there is a nuanced relationship between AI technology and popular modes of communication for Generation Z, contributing valuable insights into human-computer interactions, digital communication, and artificial intelligence literacy.},

	abstract = {Systems based on machine learning may exhibit discriminatory behavior based on sensitive characteristics such as gender, sex, religion, or race. In light of this, various notions of fairness and methods to quantify discrimination were proposed, leading to the development of numerous approaches for constructing fair predictors. At the same time, imposing fairness constraints may decrease the utility of the decision-maker, highlighting a tension between fairness and utility. This tension is also recognized in legal frameworks, for instance in the disparate impact doctrine of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- in which specific attention is given to considerations of business necessity -- possibly allowing the usage of proxy variables associated with the sensitive attribute in case a high-enough utility cannot be achieved without them. In this work, we analyze the tension between fairness and accuracy from a causal lens for the first time. We introduce the notion of a path-specific excess loss (PSEL) that captures how much the predictor's loss increases when a causal fairness constraint is enforced. We then show that the total excess loss (TEL), defined as the difference between the loss of predictor fair along all causal pathways vs. an unconstrained predictor, can be decomposed into a sum of more local PSELs. At the same time, enforcing a causal constraint often reduces the disparity between demographic groups. Thus, we introduce a quantity that summarizes the fairness-utility trade-off, called the causal fairness/utility ratio, defined as the ratio of the reduction in discrimination vs. the excess loss from constraining a causal pathway. This quantity is suitable for comparing the fairness-utility trade-off across causal pathways. Finally, as our approach requires causally-constrained fair predictors, we introduce a new neural approach for causally-constrained fair learning.},

Droplet digital ELOHA incorporates direct hybridization and single enzyme reaction via the formation of single probe-RNA-probe (enzyme) complex on magnetic beads. It enables RNA detection without reverse transcription and PCR amplification processes. The magnetic beads are subsequently encapsulated into a large number of picoliter-sized droplets with enzyme substrates in a continuous-flow device. This device is capable of generating droplets at high-throughput. It also integrates in-line enzymatic incubation and detection of fluorescent products. Our droplet digital ELOHA is able to accurately quantify (differentiate 40\% difference) as few as {\textasciitilde}600 RNA molecules in a 1 mL sample (equivalent to 1 aM or lower) without molecular replication. The absolute quantification ability of droplet digital ELOHA is demonstrated with the analysis of clinical Neisseria gonorrhoeae 16S rRNA to show its potential value in real complex samples.},

In this work, we report an easy-to-use and low-cost arbitrarily accessible 3D microfluidic device that can be easily adopted by various labs to perform combinatorial assays for high-throughput drug screening. The device is capable of precisely performing automatic and simultaneous reagent loading and aliquoting tasks and performing multistep assays with arbitrary sequences. The device is not intended to compete with other microfluidic technologies regarding ultra-low reaction volume. Instead, its freedom from tubing or pumping systems and easy operation makes it an ideal platform for routine high-throughput drug screening outside traditional microfluidic labs. The functionality and quantitative reliability of the 3D microfluidic device were demonstrated with a histone acetyltransferase-based drug-screening assay using the recombinant Plasmodium falciparum GCN5 enzyme, benchmarked with a traditional microtiter plate-based method. This arbitrarily accessible, multistep capable, low-cost, and easy-to-use device can be widely adopted in various combinatorial assays beyond high-throughput drug screening.},

	abstract = {Mechanical properties have emerged as a significant label-free marker for characterizing deformable particles such as cells. Here, we demonstrated the first single-particle-resolved, cytometry-like deformability-activated sorting in the continuous flow on a microfluidic chip. Compared with existing deformability-based sorting techniques, the microfluidic device presented in this work measures the deformability and immediately sorts the particles one-by-one in real time. It integrates the transit-time-based deformability measurement and active hydrodynamic sorting onto a single chip. We identified the critical factors that affect the sorting dynamics by modeling and experimental approaches. We found that the device throughput is determined by the summation of the sensing, buffering, and sorting time. A total time of {\textasciitilde}100 ms is used for analyzing and sorting a single particle, leading to a throughput of 600 particles/min. We synthesized poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel beads as the deformability model for device validation and performance evaluation. A deformability-activated sorting purity of 88\% and an average efficiency of 73\% were achieved. We anticipate that the ability to actively measure and sort individual particles one-by-one in a continuous flow would find applications in cell-mechanotyping studies such as correlational studies of the cell mechanical phenotype and molecular mechanism.},

Existing methods to identify these sources are either costly or unreliable. We report here a new, sensitive, and inexpensive lead detection method that relies on the formation of a perovskite semiconductor. The method only requires spraying the material of interest with methylammonium bromide and observing whether photoluminesence occurs under UV light to indicate the presence of lead. The method detects as little as 1.0 ng/mm2 of lead by the naked eye and 50 pg/mm2 using a digital photo camera. We exposed more than 50 different materials to our reagent and found no false negatives or false positives. The method readily detects lead in soil, paint, glazing, cables, glass, plastics, and dust and could be widely used for testing the environment and preventing lead poisoning.},

The most notable improvement in overall efficiency among them has been seen with PCR. Its significance for human health increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it emerged as the commonly used approach for identifying the virus. However, because of problems with speed, complexity, and expense, PCR deployment in point-of-care settings continues to be diffi­ cult. Microfluidic platforms offer a promising solution by enabling the development of smaller, more affordable, and faster PCR systems. In this review, we delve into the engineering challenges associated with the advance­ ment of high-speed microfluidic PCR equipment.

From those three, PCR has gained the most in overall performance. However, implementing PCR in point of care (POC) settings remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for a low LOD, multiplexing, accuracy, selectivity, robustness, and cost. Moreover, from a clinical point of view, it has become very desirable to attain an overall sample-to-answer time (t) of 10 min or less. Based on those POC requirements, we introduce three parameters to guide the design towards the next generation of PCR reactors: the overall sample-to-answer time (t); lambda (λ), a measure that sets the minimum number of copies required per reactor volume; and gamma (γ), the system’s thermal efficiency. These three parameters control the necessary sample volume, the number of reactors that are feasible (for multiplexing), the type of fluidics, the PCR reactor shape, the thermal conductivity, the diffusivity of the materials used, and the type of heating and cooling systems employed. Then, as an illustration, we carry out a numerical simulation of temperature changes in a PCR device, discuss the leading commercial and RT-qPCR contenders under development, and suggest approaches to achieve the PCR reactor for RT-qPCR of the future.},

Spherical gold nanoparticles are known to quench a chromophore fluorescent signal, when moieties are located in their close vicinity. The use of a polymer spacer on such a system allowed only partial recovery of the dye emission by controlling the surface to dye distance. Gold-based anisotropic sharp nanostructures appear to exhibit more interesting features due to the strong electric field generated at their edges and tips. In this paper, a complete study of hybrid fluorescent bipyramidal-like gold nanostructures is presented. We describe the chemical synthesis of gold bipyramids functionalized with fluorescent water-soluble polymers and their photophysics both in solution and on a single object. We show that the use of a bipyramidal shape instead of a spherical one leads to total recovery of the fluorescence and even to an enhancement of the emission of the dyes by a factor of 1.4.},

However, there are several limitations associated with conventional PCR, such as complicated operation, need for bulky equipment, and, in particular, long thermocycling time. Emerging nanomaterials with photothermal effects have shown great potential for developing a new generation of PCR: ultrafast photonic PCR. Here, we review recent applications of photothermal nanomaterials in ultrafast photonic PCR. First, we introduce emerging photothermal nanomaterials and their light-to-heat energy conversion process in photonic PCR. We then review different photothermal nanomaterial-based photonic PCRs and compare their merits and drawbacks. Finally, we summarize existing challenges with photonic PCR and hypothesize its promising future research directions.},

In this study, a compact continuous-flow polymerase chain reaction (PCR) microfluidics was developed for rapid analysis of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in genetically modified soybeans. The device consists of three pieces of copper and a transparent polytetrafluoroethylene capillary tube embedded in the spiral channel fabricated on the copper. On this device, the P35S and Tnos sequences were successfully amplified within 9min, and the limit of detection of the DNA sample was estimated to be 0.005ng μl−1. Furthermore, a duplex continuous-flow PCR was also reported for the detection of the P35S and Tnos sequences in GMOs simultaneously. This method was coupled with the intercalating dye SYBR Green I and the melting curve analysis of the amplified products. Using this method, temperature differences were identified by the specific melting temperature values of two sequences, and the limit of detection of the DNA sample was assessed to be 0.01ng μl−1. Therefore, our results demonstrated that the continuous-flow PCR assay could discriminate the GMOs in a cost-saving and less time-consuming way.},

Spherical gold nanoparticles are known to quench a chromophore fluorescent signal, when moieties are located in their close vicinity. The use of a polymer spacer on such a system allowed only partial recovery of the dye emission by controlling the surface to dye distance. Gold-based anisotropic sharp nanostructures appear to exhibit more interesting features due to the strong electric field generated at their edges and tips. In this paper, a complete study of hybrid fluorescent bipyramidal-like gold nanostructures is presented. We describe the chemical synthesis of gold bipyramids functionalized with fluorescent water-soluble polymers and their photophysics both in solution and on a single object. We show that the use of a bipyramidal shape instead of a spherical one leads to total recovery of the fluorescence and even to an enhancement of the emission of the dyes by a factor of 1.4.},

	abstract = {Nucleic acid amplification and quantification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most sensitive and powerful tools for clinical laboratories, precision medicine, personalized medicine, agricultural science, forensic science and environmental science. Ultrafast multiplex PCR, characterized by low power consumption, compact size and simple operation, is ideal for timely diagnosis at the point-of-care (POC). Although several fast/ultrafast PCR methods have been proposed, the use of a simple and robust PCR thermal cycler remains challenging for POC testing. Here, we present an ultrafast photonic PCR method using plasmonic photothermal light-to-heat conversion via photon–electron–phonon coupling. We demonstrate an efficient photonic heat converter using a thin gold (Au) film due to its plasmon-assisted high optical absorption (approximately 65\% at 450 nm, the peak wavelength of heat source light-emitting diodes (LEDs)). The plasmon-excited Au film is capable of rapidly heating the surrounding solution to over 150 °C within 3 min. Using this method, ultrafast thermal cycling (30 cycles; heating and cooling rate of 12.79±0.93 °C s−1 and 6.6±0.29 °C s−1, respectively) from 55 °C (temperature of annealing) to 95 °C (temperature of denaturation) is accomplished within 5 min. Using photonic PCR thermal cycles, we demonstrate here successful nucleic acid (λ-DNA) amplification. Our simple, robust and low cost approach to ultrafast PCR using an efficient photonic-based heating procedure could be generally integrated into a variety of devices or procedures, including on-chip thermal lysis and heating for isothermal amplifications.},

However, a conventional culture-based pathogen diagnostic method is time-consuming, permitting physicians to use antibiotics without ample clinical data. Here, we present a nanophotonic Light-driven Integrated cell lysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a chip with Gravity-driven cell enrichment Health Technology (LIGHT) for rapid precision detection of pathogens ({\textless}20 min). We created the LIGHT, which has the three functions of (1) selective enrichment of pathogens, (2) photothermal cell lysis, and (3) photonic PCR on a chip. We designed the gravity-driven cell enrichment via a nanoporous membrane on a chip that allows an effective bacterial enrichment of 40 000-fold from a 1 mL sample in 2 min. We established a light-driven photothermal lysis of preconcentrated bacteria within 1 min by designing the network of nanoplasmonic optical antenna on a chip for ultrafast light-to-heat conversion, created the nanoplasmonic optical antenna network-based ultrafast photonic PCR on a chip, and identified Escherichia coli. Finally, we demonstrated the end-point detection of up to 103 CFU/mL of E. coli in 10 min. We believe that our nanophotonic LIGHT will provide rapid and precise identification of pathogens in both developing and developed countries.},

Microfluidic on-chip PCR platforms provide highly efficient and small-volume bioassay for point-of-care diagnostic applications.

The on-chip configuration allows both spontaneous sample loading and microbubble-free PCR reaction during which the plasmonic nanopillar arrays result in ultrafast photothermal cycling. After rapid sample loading less than 3 min, two-step PCR results for 40 cycles show rapid amplification in 264 s for lambda-DNA, and 306 s for plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein. In addition, the in situ cyclic real-time quantification of amplicons clearly demonstrates the amplification efficiencies of more than 91\%.

	abstract = {Background Molecular diagnostics has become essential in the identification of many infectious and neglected diseases, and the detection of nucleic acids often serves as the gold standard technique for most infectious agents. However, established techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are time-consuming laboratory-bound techniques while rapid tests such as Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic tests often lack the required sensitivity and/ or specificity.
Methods/Principle findings Here we present an affordable, highly mobile alternative method for the rapid identification of infectious agents using pulse-controlled amplification (PCA). PCA is a next generation nucleic acid amplification technology that uses rapid energy pulses to heat microcyclers (micro-scale metal heating elements embedded directly in the amplification reaction) for a few microseconds, thus only heating a small fraction of the reaction volume. The heated microcyclers cool off nearly instantaneously, resulting in ultra-fast heating and cooling cycles during which classic amplification of a target sequence takes place. This reduces the overall amplification time by a factor of up to 10, enabling a sample-to-result workflow in just 15 minutes, while running on a small and portable prototype device. In this proof of principle study, we designed a PCA-assay for the detection of Yersinia pestis to demonstrate the efficacy of this technology. The observed detection limits were 434 copies per reaction (purified DNA) and 35 cells per reaction (crude sample) respectively of Yersinia pestis. Competing interests: I have read the journal’s policy and the authors SD, LU, JS and FB of this manuscript have the following competing interests: SD is working for GNA biosolutions. LU, JS and FB are the founders and CEOs of GNA biosolution.
Conclusions/Significance PCA offers fast and decentralized molecular diagnostics and is applicable whenever rapid, on-site detection of infectious agents is needed, even under resource limited conditions. It},

Despite rapid advances especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in this research field a low-cost molecular biosensor exhibiting the user-friendliness of a rapid antigen test, and also the sensitivity and specificity of a PCR test, has not been developed yet. To this end we developed a novel microfluidics based and handheld PoC device, that facilitates viral detection at PCR sensitivity and specificity in less than 40 min, including 15 min sample preparation. This was attained by incorporation of pulse controlled amplification (PCA), a method which uses short electrical pulses to rapidly increase the temperature of a small fraction of the sample volume. In this work, we present a low-cost PCA device with a microfluidic consumable intended for the use in a decentralized or home-setting. We used finite element analysis (FEA) simulations to display the fundamental principle and highlight the critical parameter dependency of PCA, such as pulse length and resistor shape. Furthermore, we integrated a simple and fast workflow for sample preparation and evaluated the limit of detection (LoD) for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, which is 0.88 copies/μL (=44 copies/reaction), and thus, comparable to conventional RT-qPCR. Additionally, target specificity of the device was validated.

The method could rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from human saliva and nasal specimens with 100\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity, as well as two distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants. The use of small optical components for both thermocycling and multiplexed fluorescence monitoring renders the instrument amenable to point-of-care use. Overall, this study demonstrates that plasmonic nanoparticles with compact optics can be used to achieve real-time and multiplexed RT-qPCR on clinical specimens, towards the goal of rapid and accurate molecular clinical diagnostics in decentralized settings.},

In this Perspective, we explore the potential application of nanopores for single-molecule temporal omics to characterize individual molecules beyond mass, in both a single-molecule and high-throughput manner. Accordingly, recent advances in nanopores available for single-molecule temporal omics are reviewed from the view of single-molecule mass identification, revealing single-molecule heterogeneity and illustrating temporal evolution.

            MicroRNA (miRNA), crucial non‐coding RNAs, have emerged as key biomarkers in molecular diagnostics, prognosis, and personalized medicine due to their significant role in gene expression regulation. Salivary miRNA, in particular, stands out for its non‐invasive collection method and ease of accessibility, offering promising avenues for the development of point‐of‐care diagnostics for a spectrum of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. Such development promises rapid and precise diagnosis, enabling timely treatment. Despite significant advancements in salivary miRNA‐based testing, challenges persist in the quantification, multiplexing, sensitivity, and specificity, particularly for miRNA at low concentrations in complex biological mixtures. This work delves into these challenges, focusing on the development and application of salivary miRNA tests for point‐of‐care use. We explore the biogenesis of salivary miRNA and analyze their quantitative expression and their disease relevance in cancer, infection, and neurodegenerative disorders. We also examined recent progress in miRNA extraction, amplification, and multiplexed detection methods. This study offers a comprehensive view of the development of salivary miRNA‐based point‐of‐care testing (POCT). Its successful advancement could revolutionize the early detection, monitoring, and management of various conditions, enhancing healthcare outcomes.

            Solid‐state nanopore sensors, a type of resistive pulse sensing, achieve optimal signal‐to‐noise performance with a single nanopore. However, the processes involved in solid‐state nanopore fabrication and subsequent measurements frequently lead to the formation of multiple nanopores, posing a challenge for precise detection. To address this issue, here, a novel and expedient technique to verify the presence of a single nanopore on a chip is developed. The methodology includes measuring the nanopore's conductance in solutions of various salt conditions, followed by a comparison of these results against a theoretical conductance model. This comparison is instrumental in distinguishing between single and multiple nanopores. Additionally, the study delves into various factors that influence the conductance curve, such as deviations in pore shape from the standard circle and inconsistencies in pore diameter. This approach significantly enhances the practical application of low‐cost nanopore preparation techniques, particularly in scenarios like controlled breakdown nanopore fabrication, where the formation of multiple nanopores is a common concern.},

	abstract = {In developing solid-state nanopore sensors for single molecule detection, comprehensive evaluation of the nanopore quality is important. Existing studies typically rely on comparing the noise root mean square or power spectrum density values. Nanopores exhibiting lower noise values are generally considered superior. This evaluation is valid when the single molecule signal remains consistent. However, the signal can vary, as it is strongly related to the solid-state nanopore size, which is hard to control during fabrication consistently. This work emphasized the need to report the baseline current for evaluating solid-state nanopore sensors. The baseline current offers insight into several experimental conditions, particularly the nanopore size. Our experiments show that a nanopore sensor with more noise is not necessarily worse when considering the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), particularly when the pore size is smaller. Our findings suggest that relying only on noise comparisons can lead to inaccurate evaluations of solid-state nanopore sensors, considering the inherent variability in fabrication and testing setups among labs and measurements. We propose that future studies should include reporting baseline current and sensing conditions. Additionally, using SNR as a primary evaluation tool for nanopore sensors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of their performance.},

          , 
            
              Upstream sample preparation remains the bottleneck for point-of-need nucleic acid testing due to its complexity and time-consuming nature. Sample preparation involves extracting, purifying, and concentrating nucleic acids from various matrices. These processes are critical for ensuring the accuracy and sensitivity of downstream nucleic acid amplification and detection. However, current sample preparation methods are often laboratory-based, requiring specialized equipment, trained personnel, and several hours of processing time. As a result, sample preparation often limits the speed, portability, and cost-effectiveness of point-of-need nucleic acid testing. A universal, field-deployable sample preparation device is highly desirable for this critical need and unmet challenge. Here we reported a handheld, battery-powered, reconfigurable, and field-deployable nucleic acid sample preparation device. A programmable electromagnetic actuator was developed to drive a magnetic robot (ProMagBot) in
              X
              /
              Y
              2D space, such that various magnetic bead-based sample preparations can be readily translated from the laboratory to point-of-need settings. The control of the electromagnetic actuator requires only a 3-phase unipolar voltage in
              X
              and
              Y
              directions, and therefore, the motion space is highly scalable. We validated the ProMagBot device with a model application by extracting HIV viral RNAs from plasma samples using two widely used magnetic bead kits: ChargeSwitch and MagMAX beads. In both cases, the ProMagBot could successfully extract viral RNAs from 50 μL plasma samples containing as low as 10
              2
              copies of viral RNAs in 20 minutes. Our results demonstrated the ability of ProMagBot to prepare samples from complex mediums at the point of need. We believe such a device would enable rapid and robust sample preparation in various settings, including resource-limited or remote environments, and accelerate the development of next-generation point-of-need nucleic acid testing.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            While the electrical models of the membrane-based solid-state nanopores have been well established, silicon-based pyramidal nanopores cannot apply these models due to two distinctive features. One is its 35.3° half cone angle, which brings additional resistance to the moving ions inside the nanopore. The other is its rectangular entrance, which makes calculating the access conductance challenging. Here, we proposed and validated an effective transport model (ETM) for silicon-based pyramidal nanopores by introducing effective conductivity. The impact of half cone angle can be described equivalently using a reduced diffusion coefficient (effective diffusion coefficient). Because the decrease of diffusion coefficient results in a smaller conductivity, effective conductivity is used for the calculation of bulk conductance in ETM. In the classical model, intrinsic conductivity is used. We used the top-down fabrication method for generating the pyramidal silicon nanopores to test the proposed model. Compared with the large error (≥25\% in most cases) when using the classical model, the error of ETM in predicting conductance is less than 15\%. We also found that the ETM is applicable when the ratio of excess ion concentration and bulk ion concentration is smaller than 0.2. At last, it is proved that ETM can estimate the tip size of pyramidal silicon nanopore. We believe the ETM would provide an improved method for evaluating the pyramidal silicon nanopores.},

            Controlled molecular transport and separation is of significant importance in various applications. In this work, we presented a novel concept of nanofluidic molecular charge-coupled device (CCD) for controlled DNA transport and separation. By leveraging the unique field-effect coupling in nanofluidic systems, the nanofluidic molecular CCD aims to store charged biomolecules such as DNAs in discrete regions in nanochannels and transfer and separate these biomolecules as a charge packet in a bucket brigade fashion. We developed a quantitative model to capture the impact of nanochannel surface charge, gating voltage and frequency, molecule diffusivity, and gating electrode geometry on the transport and separation efficiency. We studied the synergistic effects of these factors to guide the device design and optimize the DNA transport and separation in a nanofluidic CCD. The findings in this study provided insight into the rational design and implementation of the nanofluidic molecular CCD.},

Since the first α-hemolysin biological nanopore, various types of nanopores made of different materials have been under extensive development. Noise represents a common challenge among all types of nanopore sensors. The nanopore noise can be decomposed into four components in the frequency domain (1/f noise, white noise, dielectric noise, and amplifier noise). In this work, we reviewed and summarized the physical models, origins, and reduction methods for each of these noise components. For the first time, we quantitatively benchmarked the root mean square (RMS) noise levels for different types of nanopores, demonstrating a clear material-dependent RMS noise. We anticipate this review article will enhance the understanding of nanopore sensor noises and provide an informative tutorial for developing future nanopore sensors with a high signal-to-noise ratio.},

              As the technical performance and reliability of white organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) begin to mature, broader adoption in the lighting market will increasingly rely on exploiting the unique aesthetic opportunities that OLEDs afford. Here, kirigami‐based concepts that enable ultraflexible thin film OLEDs to be cut, folded, and “popped up” into a variety of 3D shapes ranging from globes to candle flame mimics are used. It is demonstrated that large area ({\textgreater}15 cm
              2
              ) OLEDs fabricated and encapsulated on sub‐50 µm thick polyimide films can be cut and folded into 3D with negligible impact on their efficiency and electrical characteristics. These results point to an alternate paradigm for OLED lighting that moves beyond traditional 2D panels toward 3D designs that deliver unique and creative new opportunities for lighting.},

          , 
            
              In response to the urgent need of a field-deployable and highly sensitive malaria diagnosis, we developed a standalone, “sample-in-answer-out” molecular diagnostic system (AnyMDx) to enable quantitative molecular analysis of blood-borne malaria in low resource areas. The system consists of a durable battery-powered analyzer and a disposable microfluidic compact disc loaded with reagents ready for use. A low power thermal module and a novel fluorescence-sensing module are integrated into the analyzer for real-time monitoring of loop-mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) of target parasite DNA. With 10 μL of raw blood sample, the AnyMDx system automates the nucleic acid sample preparation and subsequent LAMP and real-time detection. Under laboratory conditions with whole-blood samples spiked with cultured
              Plasmodium falciparum
              , we achieved a detection limit of ∼0.6 parasite per μL, much lower than those for the conventional microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (∼50–100 parasites per μL). The turnaround time from sample to answer is less than 40 minutes. The AnyMDx is user-friendly requiring minimal technological training. The analyzer and the disposable reagent compact discs are cost-effective, making AnyMDx a potential tool for malaria molecular diagnosis under field settings for malaria elimination.},
