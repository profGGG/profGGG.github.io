            MicroRNA (miRNA), crucial non‐coding RNAs, have emerged as key biomarkers in molecular diagnostics, prognosis, and personalized medicine due to their significant role in gene expression regulation. Salivary miRNA, in particular, stands out for its non‐invasive collection method and ease of accessibility, offering promising avenues for the development of point‐of‐care diagnostics for a spectrum of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious diseases. Such development promises rapid and precise diagnosis, enabling timely treatment. Despite significant advancements in salivary miRNA‐based testing, challenges persist in the quantification, multiplexing, sensitivity, and specificity, particularly for miRNA at low concentrations in complex biological mixtures. This work delves into these challenges, focusing on the development and application of salivary miRNA tests for point‐of‐care use. We explore the biogenesis of salivary miRNA and analyze their quantitative expression and their disease relevance in cancer, infection, and neurodegenerative disorders. We also examined recent progress in miRNA extraction, amplification, and multiplexed detection methods. This study offers a comprehensive view of the development of salivary miRNA‐based point‐of‐care testing (POCT). Its successful advancement could revolutionize the early detection, monitoring, and management of various conditions, enhancing healthcare outcomes.

            Solid‐state nanopore sensors, a type of resistive pulse sensing, achieve optimal signal‐to‐noise performance with a single nanopore. However, the processes involved in solid‐state nanopore fabrication and subsequent measurements frequently lead to the formation of multiple nanopores, posing a challenge for precise detection. To address this issue, here, a novel and expedient technique to verify the presence of a single nanopore on a chip is developed. The methodology includes measuring the nanopore's conductance in solutions of various salt conditions, followed by a comparison of these results against a theoretical conductance model. This comparison is instrumental in distinguishing between single and multiple nanopores. Additionally, the study delves into various factors that influence the conductance curve, such as deviations in pore shape from the standard circle and inconsistencies in pore diameter. This approach significantly enhances the practical application of low‐cost nanopore preparation techniques, particularly in scenarios like controlled breakdown nanopore fabrication, where the formation of multiple nanopores is a common concern.},

	abstract = {In developing solid-state nanopore sensors for single molecule detection, comprehensive evaluation of the nanopore quality is important. Existing studies typically rely on comparing the noise root mean square or power spectrum density values. Nanopores exhibiting lower noise values are generally considered superior. This evaluation is valid when the single molecule signal remains consistent. However, the signal can vary, as it is strongly related to the solid-state nanopore size, which is hard to control during fabrication consistently. This work emphasized the need to report the baseline current for evaluating solid-state nanopore sensors. The baseline current offers insight into several experimental conditions, particularly the nanopore size. Our experiments show that a nanopore sensor with more noise is not necessarily worse when considering the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), particularly when the pore size is smaller. Our findings suggest that relying only on noise comparisons can lead to inaccurate evaluations of solid-state nanopore sensors, considering the inherent variability in fabrication and testing setups among labs and measurements. We propose that future studies should include reporting baseline current and sensing conditions. Additionally, using SNR as a primary evaluation tool for nanopore sensors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of their performance.},

          , 
            
              Upstream sample preparation remains the bottleneck for point-of-need nucleic acid testing due to its complexity and time-consuming nature. Sample preparation involves extracting, purifying, and concentrating nucleic acids from various matrices. These processes are critical for ensuring the accuracy and sensitivity of downstream nucleic acid amplification and detection. However, current sample preparation methods are often laboratory-based, requiring specialized equipment, trained personnel, and several hours of processing time. As a result, sample preparation often limits the speed, portability, and cost-effectiveness of point-of-need nucleic acid testing. A universal, field-deployable sample preparation device is highly desirable for this critical need and unmet challenge. Here we reported a handheld, battery-powered, reconfigurable, and field-deployable nucleic acid sample preparation device. A programmable electromagnetic actuator was developed to drive a magnetic robot (ProMagBot) in
              X
              /
              Y
              2D space, such that various magnetic bead-based sample preparations can be readily translated from the laboratory to point-of-need settings. The control of the electromagnetic actuator requires only a 3-phase unipolar voltage in
              X
              and
              Y
              directions, and therefore, the motion space is highly scalable. We validated the ProMagBot device with a model application by extracting HIV viral RNAs from plasma samples using two widely used magnetic bead kits: ChargeSwitch and MagMAX beads. In both cases, the ProMagBot could successfully extract viral RNAs from 50 μL plasma samples containing as low as 10
              2
              copies of viral RNAs in 20 minutes. Our results demonstrated the ability of ProMagBot to prepare samples from complex mediums at the point of need. We believe such a device would enable rapid and robust sample preparation in various settings, including resource-limited or remote environments, and accelerate the development of next-generation point-of-need nucleic acid testing.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            While the electrical models of the membrane-based solid-state nanopores have been well established, silicon-based pyramidal nanopores cannot apply these models due to two distinctive features. One is its 35.3° half cone angle, which brings additional resistance to the moving ions inside the nanopore. The other is its rectangular entrance, which makes calculating the access conductance challenging. Here, we proposed and validated an effective transport model (ETM) for silicon-based pyramidal nanopores by introducing effective conductivity. The impact of half cone angle can be described equivalently using a reduced diffusion coefficient (effective diffusion coefficient). Because the decrease of diffusion coefficient results in a smaller conductivity, effective conductivity is used for the calculation of bulk conductance in ETM. In the classical model, intrinsic conductivity is used. We used the top-down fabrication method for generating the pyramidal silicon nanopores to test the proposed model. Compared with the large error (≥25\% in most cases) when using the classical model, the error of ETM in predicting conductance is less than 15\%. We also found that the ETM is applicable when the ratio of excess ion concentration and bulk ion concentration is smaller than 0.2. At last, it is proved that ETM can estimate the tip size of pyramidal silicon nanopore. We believe the ETM would provide an improved method for evaluating the pyramidal silicon nanopores.},

It can serve as a promising label-free marker of cells’ physiological states. In the past two decades, several techniques have been developed for understanding correlations between cellular mechanical changes and human diseases. However, numerous technical challenges remain with regard to realizing high-throughput, robust, and easy-to-perform measurements of single-cell mechanical properties. In this paper, we review the emerging tools for single-cell mechanical characterization that are provided by microfluidic technology. Different techniques are benchmarked by considering their advantages and limitations. Finally, the potential applications of microfluidic techniques based on cellular mechanical properties are discussed.},

            Controlled molecular transport and separation is of significant importance in various applications. In this work, we presented a novel concept of nanofluidic molecular charge-coupled device (CCD) for controlled DNA transport and separation. By leveraging the unique field-effect coupling in nanofluidic systems, the nanofluidic molecular CCD aims to store charged biomolecules such as DNAs in discrete regions in nanochannels and transfer and separate these biomolecules as a charge packet in a bucket brigade fashion. We developed a quantitative model to capture the impact of nanochannel surface charge, gating voltage and frequency, molecule diffusivity, and gating electrode geometry on the transport and separation efficiency. We studied the synergistic effects of these factors to guide the device design and optimize the DNA transport and separation in a nanofluidic CCD. The findings in this study provided insight into the rational design and implementation of the nanofluidic molecular CCD.},

Since the first α-hemolysin biological nanopore, various types of nanopores made of different materials have been under extensive development. Noise represents a common challenge among all types of nanopore sensors. The nanopore noise can be decomposed into four components in the frequency domain (1/f noise, white noise, dielectric noise, and amplifier noise). In this work, we reviewed and summarized the physical models, origins, and reduction methods for each of these noise components. For the first time, we quantitatively benchmarked the root mean square (RMS) noise levels for different types of nanopores, demonstrating a clear material-dependent RMS noise. We anticipate this review article will enhance the understanding of nanopore sensor noises and provide an informative tutorial for developing future nanopore sensors with a high signal-to-noise ratio.},

              As the technical performance and reliability of white organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) begin to mature, broader adoption in the lighting market will increasingly rely on exploiting the unique aesthetic opportunities that OLEDs afford. Here, kirigami‐based concepts that enable ultraflexible thin film OLEDs to be cut, folded, and “popped up” into a variety of 3D shapes ranging from globes to candle flame mimics are used. It is demonstrated that large area ({\textgreater}15 cm
              2
              ) OLEDs fabricated and encapsulated on sub‐50 µm thick polyimide films can be cut and folded into 3D with negligible impact on their efficiency and electrical characteristics. These results point to an alternate paradigm for OLED lighting that moves beyond traditional 2D panels toward 3D designs that deliver unique and creative new opportunities for lighting.},

          , 
            
              In response to the urgent need of a field-deployable and highly sensitive malaria diagnosis, we developed a standalone, “sample-in-answer-out” molecular diagnostic system (AnyMDx) to enable quantitative molecular analysis of blood-borne malaria in low resource areas. The system consists of a durable battery-powered analyzer and a disposable microfluidic compact disc loaded with reagents ready for use. A low power thermal module and a novel fluorescence-sensing module are integrated into the analyzer for real-time monitoring of loop-mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) of target parasite DNA. With 10 μL of raw blood sample, the AnyMDx system automates the nucleic acid sample preparation and subsequent LAMP and real-time detection. Under laboratory conditions with whole-blood samples spiked with cultured
              Plasmodium falciparum
              , we achieved a detection limit of ∼0.6 parasite per μL, much lower than those for the conventional microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (∼50–100 parasites per μL). The turnaround time from sample to answer is less than 40 minutes. The AnyMDx is user-friendly requiring minimal technological training. The analyzer and the disposable reagent compact discs are cost-effective, making AnyMDx a potential tool for malaria molecular diagnosis under field settings for malaria elimination.},
