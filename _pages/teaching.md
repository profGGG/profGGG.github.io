## EE 310 Electronic Circuit Design I

In this course, we learn about the electrical properties of different fundamental semiconductor devices and their basic circuit design applications. This course deals explicitly with both linear and nonlinear applications of devices, and with the practical aspects of design such as the inherently nonlinear nature of semiconductor devices. The analysis concepts introduced in your previous network course are utilized and advanced in their treatment of nonlinear devices. In the laboratory, we put the theory into practice.

## EE 442 Solid State Devices

The lecture provides learning opportunities that should enable the students to do the following upon completion of this course:

1. Develop a basic understanding of the following key concepts in quantum and statistical mechanics relevant to the physical properties of electronic materials and their device applications:
   - Quantum mechanics
   - Statistical mechanics
   - Equilibrium vs non-equilibrium properties
   - P-N junctions
   - Photodetectors
   - MOS field effect transistors
2. Become proficient with fundamental device physics concepts.
3. Learn to analyze device characteristics in detail and brainstorm ways towards improving them or adapting them to new applications for a sustainable digital future.

## EE 597 Micro & Nano Medical Devices

This graduate-level class is offered for students who are interested in multi-disciplinary micro and nanoscale medical device principles and applications. This course targets to:
1. Introduce fundamental design and fabrication concepts of micro and nanoscale MEMS, fluidics, and lab-on-a-chip systems.
2. Provide exposure to relevant biomedical and biological applications.
3. Teach students how to do literature surveys, write and evaluate an NIH-type research proposal.
4. Expose students to the medical device industry and relevant regulations.
